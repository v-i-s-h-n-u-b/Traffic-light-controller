# Traffic-light-controller

A Traffic Light Controller using Verilog HDL, handling state transitions for North-South and
East-West traffic lights with red, yellow, and green signals, including emergency vehicle response and pedestrian crossing.
Implemented different timing parameters for state transitions, including configurable durations for red, yellow, green lights, 
emergency vehicles and pedestrain crossing to simulate realistic traffic light behavior. 

Functionally verified using testbench.

Note : FPGA implementation to be updated
